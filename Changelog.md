Changelog of Nekland Places API
===============================

v1.1.0, 2015-04-XX:

* Serious compatibility break with the Search API. This is due to an error while naming this method. To avoid any problem with old PHP releases
we need to rename this method, the new name is `searchLocation`.
* Serious compatibility break with the Autocomplete API for same reasons.
